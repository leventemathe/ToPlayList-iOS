# ToPlayList-iOS
An iOS app for discovering new games

Browse the newest releases or upcoming lists to discover new games, or search for specific ones.  
Save the games you want to play or have played to your ToPlay list or Played list.  

ToPlayList was my first iOS app ever, I learned basic iOS development, Swift, git etc. with this project.  
I built it during the time I was studying Computer Science at university in Budapest, so as you can imagine, the code is far from perfect.
